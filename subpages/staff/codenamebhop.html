<p>CodeNameBhop is the creator of the Endangered Entertainment Channel, and mainly focuses on technical aspects, they also script write (like everyone else)</p>
<p>The legacy of this channel is, confusing, the series that was made on this channel was labeled Sole Surviver (yes not even fucking around) but was correctly renamed to Sole Survivor. Sole Survivor was made by Sunset and was made into a series on a seprate channel.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say about the legacy of this channel, but a page for that will be made soon!</p>
