<h1>About Us</h1>
<hr>
<p>We create movies and machinima in Garry's Mod, we have two ongoing projects currently, Half-Life Further Information and Sole Survivor. Sole Survivor was based off a old series on the channel, back then called PhysGun Productions. The series was not really good, and we've learned from our past mistakes and hope to improve on the quality of our videos.</p>
